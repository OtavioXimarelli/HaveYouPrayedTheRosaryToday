## The Most Frequent Question

Almost everyone who encounters the Rosary for the first time has the same doubt:

> *"Why not pray directly to Jesus? Why do we need Mary on the way?"*

It is a legitimate question. And the honest answer is: **you don't need Mary to get to Jesus**. The Rosary is not mandatory for salvation. It is a devotional choice — a school of contemplation that the Church recognizes as very effective.

But understanding *why* we pray with Mary, and not just *to* God directly, opens an important theological perspective.

## Worship vs. Veneration: The Fundamental Distinction

The Catholic Church is clear and rigorous on this point:

- **Worship (latria)** — due only to God. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
- **Veneration (dulia)** — respect and honor to the saints, who are with God.
- **Hyperdulia** — special veneration to Mary, for her unique role as Mother of God.

When we pray the Rosary, **we do not worship Mary**. We ask her to intercede for us — just as we ask a friend to pray for us.

Saint Louis de Montfort clarified this with precision:

> "Going to Jesus through Mary is not moving away from Jesus — it is the path that Jesus himself chose to come to us."

## Mary in the New Testament

Devotion to Mary is not a medieval invention. It is present from the earliest Christian texts:

**Luke 1:28** — The angel Gabriel greets Mary with an unprecedented salutation: *"Rejoice, full of grace!"* — it is not her name, it is her *identity*.

**Luke 1:41-45** — Elizabeth, filled with the Holy Spirit, exclaims: *"How is it granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"* — Mary is called "mother of my Lord" before Jesus is born.

**John 2:1-11** — At the Wedding at Cana, Mary intercedes with Jesus for the hosts. Jesus answers — even saying that "his hour had not yet come". Mary knew that her Son would hear her request.

**John 19:26-27** — From the Cross, Jesus entrusts Mary to John: *"Woman, behold your son"* — and to John: *"Behold your mother."* Tradition sees here the adoption of the entire Church as children of Mary.

## The Intercession of the Saints

There is a clear biblical logic for asking for the intercession of other Christians:

**James 5:16** says: *"The fervent prayer of a righteous person is very powerful."*

If you ask a pious friend to pray for you — you are asking for intercession. Does that make sense? For most people, yes.

The question is: why would it stop with death? If the saints are *more* alive in God than we are here (Rev 6:9-10 shows martyrs interceding before the throne), why not ask for their intercession?

Mary is the first among the saints — not by her own merits, but by pure grace: she is the Mother of Jesus. Her role as intercessor does not compete with the unique priesthood of Christ (1 Tim 2:5) — she intercedes *in Christ*, not as a replacement for Him.

## Mary in the Rosary: What does she do?

In the Rosary, Mary has a specific function: **she points to Jesus**.

Think about how it works: we pray the Hail Marys, but **we meditate on the mysteries of the life of Christ**. Mary never takes her eyes off Jesus — nor should she take ours.

The Rosary is, in fact, a **Christocentric prayer**: we begin with the Apostle's Creed (faith in Christ), meditate on his life, death, and resurrection, and we do so in the company of his mother.

In the words of John Paul II:

> "The Rosary is essentially a contemplative prayer. Without this contemplative dimension, it loses its meaning."

And contemplation is always about Christ — Mary is the *teacher* who teaches us to look at Him.

## If the Doubt Persists

If you still have resistance to Marian devotion, do not force yourself. A Rosary prayed with honest doubt but good will has more value than a Rosary prayed by routine without questioning.

What matters is the intention to reach Christ. If Mary helps with that, fine. If for now you prefer to pray *only* to Jesus — pray. The Father of Mercy does not measure prayer by form, but by the heart.
