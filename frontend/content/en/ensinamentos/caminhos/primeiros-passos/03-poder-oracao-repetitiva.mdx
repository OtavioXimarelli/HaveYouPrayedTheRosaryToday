## The Obvious Objection

> *"But doesn't the Bible say it is forbidden to repeat prayers too much? Matthew 6:7 says not to 'babble like the pagans!'"*

It is an old and honest objection. And it deserves a serious answer, not an evasion.

The text of Matthew 6:7 says, in the original Greek: *"In praying, do not babble (**battalogēsēte**) like the pagans."* The word *battalogos* literally means *senseless talk, empty chatter* — not devotional repetition with intention.

In the same discourse, Jesus teaches the Our Father — a prayer to be prayed by His disciples. And in the Gospels, Jesus Himself repeats the same prayer three times in Gethsemane (Mt 26:44). The Psalms are replete with intentional parallelisms and repetitions.

The issue is not repetition — it is **emptiness**. Repetition with attention is the very structure of contemplation.

## Repetition in Scripture

The Bible does not merely tolerate repetition — it **celebrates** it.

Psalm 136 is perhaps the most striking example. There are 26 verses, and **every one** ends with the same refrain: *"For his mercy endures forever."* Twenty-six times. It is not the psalmist's oversight — it is a deliberate choice. Each repetition of the refrain does not say less; it says *more*, because it follows a new reason for praise:

> "Who made the heavens with wisdom — for his mercy endures forever.
> Who spread the earth upon the waters — for his mercy endures forever.
> Who made the great lights — for his mercy endures forever."
> — Psalm 136:5-7

Each line changes the context; the refrain remains. And with each repetition, the truth deepens. This is exactly what happens in the Rosary: the Hail Marys are the refrain; the mysteries are the verses that change.

In Revelation, the four living creatures before the throne of God *"do not cease to exclaim day and night: 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God almighty'"* (Rev 4:8). The heavenly liturgy is, itself, repetitive — and no one accuses the angels of babbling.

## How Repetition Frees Attention

There is a psychological paradox that any practitioner of meditation knows:

**When the mind has a simple and familiar task, it becomes free to go deeper.**

Think of an experienced musician: their fingers know the scales so well that they no longer require conscious attention. This *frees* the attention for musical expression.

The Rosary works the same way. After a few days, the words of the Hail Mary become so familiar that the mind no longer needs to *think* about them. They rise like breathing. And in that freed space — while the lips move and the hands touch the beads — the interior attention can rest in the mysteries.

Neuroscientists call this the **default attentional mode**: when a task is sufficiently automated, the default neural network activates and allows deeper contemplative processing.

The medieval monks discovered this empirically 700 years before neuroscience.

## Science and Prayer: The Relaxation Response

In the 1970s, cardiologist Herbert Benson of Harvard Medical School studied the physiological effects of repetitive prayer and meditation. He discovered what he called the **"relaxation response"**: when a person repeats a word, phrase, or prayer in a rhythmic and focused manner, the body enters a state opposite to stress — heart rate decreases, blood pressure drops, breathing becomes deeper.

Benson tested practitioners from various traditions — including Christians who prayed the Rosary and the Jesus Prayer. The results were consistent: **repetitive prayer not only calms the mind but modifies the body's physiology**.

This does not mean the Rosary is reducible to a relaxation technique. It means that God created the human being in such a way that repetitive prayer produces conditions favorable for contemplation — body and soul work together. As the Catechism teaches: *"Christian prayer is a personal and living relationship of the children of God with their Father who is infinitely good, with his Son Jesus Christ, and with the Holy Spirit"* (CCC §2565). Science illuminates the *how*; faith reveals the *Who*.

More recent studies, published in the *Journal of Religion and Health*, confirmed that praying the Rosary produces a natural respiratory synchronization — the rhythm of the Hail Marys tends to align with the respiratory cycle, producing about six breaths per minute, which is associated with greater cardiovascular coherence. The monks could not explain *why* it worked; we now know that the body was made for prayer.

## The Tradition of the Desert Fathers

Centuries before the Rosary took the form we know, the Desert Fathers of Egypt (3rd–5th centuries) already practiced repetitive prayer as a path to God.

Evagrius Ponticus (345–399) taught the repetition of short Scripture verses as a weapon against the *logismoi* — the intrusive thoughts that disturb prayer. Saint John Cassian (360–435) brought this tradition to the West and recommended the unceasing repetition of the verse: *"O God, come to my assistance! O Lord, make haste to help me!"* (Ps 70:2).

> "With this verse, the monk will find the secret of persevering in continuous prayer."
> — Saint John Cassian, *Conferences*, X, 10

This practice flourished in the Christian East as the **Jesus Prayer**: the continuous repetition of the phrase *"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner."*

## The Way of a Pilgrim

The Russian classic *The Way of a Pilgrim* (nineteenth century) documents the experience of a peasant who learned to pray the Jesus Prayer until it became **synchronized with his heartbeat** — completely interiorized, prayed "without ceasing" in the sense of 1 Thessalonians 5:17.

The pilgrim describes the moment when the prayer ceased to be effort and became presence:

> "It is no longer I who pray; the prayer prays itself within me."

The logic is the same as the Rosary: repetition does not impoverish prayer — it **deepens** it, until it passes from an exterior act to a permanent interior disposition. It is what the Catechism calls *prayer of the heart*: *"The heart is the dwelling-place where I am, where I live [...]. The heart is the place of truth, where we choose life or death"* (CCC §2563).

## The Rosary and the Three Degrees of Prayer

The Catechism distinguishes three expressions of prayer: **vocal, meditative, and contemplative** (CCC §2700-2724). The Rosary, remarkably, contains all three within itself.

### Level 1: Vocal (Beginner)
You pray the words with attention to the words. This is already good. The mind is on the lips, not on the mysteries — and that is fine. It is the beginning. The Catechism reminds us: *"Vocal prayer is an essential element of the Christian life"* (CCC §2701).

### Level 2: Meditative (Intermediate)
You announce the mystery, form a mental image of the scene, and hold that image while praying the Hail Marys. The image sometimes drifts away — you gently bring it back. It is like training a muscle. *"Meditation is above all a quest. The mind seeks to understand the why and how of the Christian life"* (CCC §2705).

### Level 3: Contemplative (Advanced)
The Hail Marys flow like breathing. The image of the mystery has given way to a *presence* — less visual, more direct. There are moments of interior silence even while the words are being prayed. Saint Louis de Montfort called this the *interior of the Rosary*. The Catechism describes: *"Contemplative prayer is the simple expression of the mystery of prayer. It is a gaze of faith fixed on Jesus, [...] a silent love"* (CCC §2724).

No level is "wrong." Holiness does not require that you reach Level 3. Saint Thérèse fell asleep during the Rosary and is a Doctor of the Church. What matters is to pray with an open heart, at whatever level you are today.

The Catechism itself encourages this freedom: *"Entering into contemplative prayer is like entering into the Eucharistic liturgy: we 'gather up' the heart, [...] in order to prepare ourselves for the encounter with the Lord"* (CCC §2711). Each person makes this recollection at their own pace.

> "God does not look at the greatness of the works, nor at their difficulty, but at the love with which they are done."
> — Saint Thérèse of the Child Jesus

## Practice: The Mindful Rosary

Try this exercise this week:

**Before praying the Rosary:**
- Take three deep breaths, inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth
- Place your hand over your heart and notice your heartbeat for a few seconds
- Say softly: *"I come to pray the Rosary. My intention is [name the intention]. Mary, show me Jesus."*

**During each decade:**
- Announce the mystery aloud (even if alone)
- Close your eyes for 10 seconds and form an image of the scene
- Pray the Hail Marys. If the mind wanders, do not blame yourself — gently return to the image
- At the end of the decade, pause for 5 seconds of silence

**After the Rosary:**
- Do not get up immediately. Stay in silence for 1 minute
- Ask: *"What remained?"*
- If a word or image lingers, write it down — it may be the seed of a grace

Do not evaluate the quality of the experience. Simply observe. As Saint John of the Cross taught:

> "Contemplation is nothing other than a secret, peaceful, and loving infusion of God."
