## The Obvious Objection

> *"But don't you say it's forbidden to repeat prayers a lot? Matthew 6:7 says one should not 'heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do!'"*

It is an old and honest objection. And it deserves a serious answer, not an evasion.

The text of Matthew 6:7 says, in the original Greek: *"And in praying do not heap up empty phrases (**battalogēsēte**) as the Gentiles do."* The word *battalogos* literally means *meaningless speech, empty babble* — not devotional repetition with intention.

In the same discourse, Jesus teaches the Our Father — a prayer to be prayed by the disciples. And in the Gospels, Jesus himself repeats the same prayer three times in Gethsemane (Mt 26:44). The Psalms are full of parallelisms and intentional repetitions.

The issue is not repetition — it is **emptiness**. Repetition with attention is the very structure of contemplation.

## How Repetition Frees Attention

There is a psychological paradox that any practitioner of meditation knows:

**When the mind has a simple and familiar task, it is free to go deeper.**

Think of an experienced musician: their fingers know the scales so well that they do not need conscious attention. This *frees* the attention for musical expression.

The Rosary works the same way. After a few days, the words of the Hail Mary become so familiar that the mind no longer needs to *think* about them. They rise like breathing. And in that freed space — while the lips move and the hands touch the beads — the inner attention can rest on the mysteries.

Neuroscientists call this the **attentional default mode**: when a task is sufficiently automated, the default neural network activates and allows for deeper contemplative processing.

Medieval monks discovered this empirically 700 years before neuroscience.

## The Tradition of the *Jesus Prayer*

The Eastern Christian tradition has a parallel practice called the **Jesus Prayer**: the continuous repetition of the phrase *"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner."*

The Russian classic *The Way of a Pilgrim* (19th century) documents the experience of a peasant who learned to pray this prayer until it became **synchronized with his heartbeat** — that is, completely internalized, prayed "without ceasing" in the sense of 1 Thess 5:17.

The logic is the same as the Rosary: repetition does not impoverish prayer — it **deepens** it, until it passes from an outer act to a permanent inner disposition.

## The Three Levels of the Rosary

Practically speaking, there are three ways to pray the Rosary — corresponding to stages of spiritual maturity:

### Level 1: Vocal (Beginner)
You pray the words with attention to the words. This is already good. The mind is on the lips, not on the mysteries — and that's okay. It's the beginning.

### Level 2: Meditative (Intermediate)
You announce the mystery, form a mental image of the scene, and maintain that image while praying the Hail Marys. The image sometimes goes away — you gently bring it back. It's like training a muscle.

### Level 3: Contemplative (Advanced)
The Hail Marys flow like breathing. The image of the mystery has given way to a *presence* — less visual, more direct. There are moments of inner silence even while the words are prayed. Saint Louis de Montfort called this the *interior of the Rosary*.

No level is "wrong". Holiness does not require you to reach level 3. Saint Thérèse slept during the Rosary and is a Doctor of the Church.

## Practice: The Conscious Rosary

Try this exercise this week:

**Before praying the Rosary:**
- Take three deep breaths
- Say quietly: *"I come to pray the Rosary. My intention is [name the intention]. Mary, show me Jesus."*

**During each decade:**
- Announce the mystery aloud (even if alone)
- Close your eyes for 10 seconds and form an image of the scene
- Pray the Hail Marys. If the mind wanders, do not blame yourself — gently return to the image
- At the end of the decade, pause for 5 seconds of silence

**After the Rosary:**
- Do not get up immediately. Stay in silence for 1 minute
- Ask: *"What remained?"*

Do not evaluate the quality of the experience. Just observe.
