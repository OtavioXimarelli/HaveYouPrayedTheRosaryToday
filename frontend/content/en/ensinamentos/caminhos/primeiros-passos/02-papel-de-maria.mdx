## The Most Frequent Question

Nearly every person who encounters the Rosary for the first time has the same question:

> *"Why not pray directly to Jesus? Why do we need Mary along the way?"*

It is a legitimate question. And the honest answer is: **you do not need Mary to reach Jesus**. The Rosary is not required for salvation. It is a devotional choice — a school of contemplation that the Church recognizes as highly effective.

But understanding *why* we pray with Mary, and not solely *to* God directly, opens an important theological perspective — one that is profoundly biblical.

## Adoration vs. Veneration: The Fundamental Distinction

The Catholic Church is clear and rigorous on this point:

- **Adoration (latria)** — due to God alone. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
- **Veneration (dulia)** — respect and honor given to the saints, who are with God.
- **Hyperdulia** — special veneration given to Mary, because of her unique role as Mother of God.

When we pray the Rosary, **we do not worship Mary**. We ask her to intercede for us — just as we ask a friend to pray for us.

Saint Louis de Montfort clarified this with precision:

> "To go to Jesus through Mary is not to move away from Jesus — it is the very path that Jesus Himself chose to come to us."

The Catechism confirms: *"What the Catholic faith believes about Mary is based on what it believes about Christ, and what it teaches about Mary illumines in turn its faith in Christ"* (CCC §487).

## Theotókos — The Title That Defined the Faith

In 431, the Council of Ephesus solemnly proclaimed that Mary is **Theotókos** — *Mother of God*. This title is not an extravagant exaltation of Mary; it is a statement about **Jesus**. If Jesus is truly God incarnate — and not merely a man upon whom God descended afterward — then she who bore Him is, by right, the Mother of God.

The debate at Ephesus was intense. Nestorius of Constantinople wanted to call her only *Christotókos* (Mother of Christ), fearing confusion. But the Council Fathers understood: to diminish Mary's motherhood was to diminish the divinity of Christ. The title *Theotókos* safeguards the faith in the Incarnation.

> "Mary is Mother of God not because the divine nature of the Word had its origin in her, but because from her was born the sacred body endowed with a rational soul, to which the Word of God was united according to the hypostasis."
> — Council of Ephesus (431)

## Mary in the New Testament

Devotion to Mary is not a medieval invention. It is present from the earliest Christian texts:

**Luke 1:28** — The Angel Gabriel greets Mary with an unprecedented salutation: *"Hail, full of grace!"* — it is not her name; it is her *identity*.

**Luke 1:41-45** — Elizabeth, filled with the Holy Spirit, exclaims: *"And how does this happen to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"* — Mary is called "mother of my Lord" before Jesus is born.

**Luke 1:48** — Mary prophesies about herself: *"All generations will call me blessed."* When we honor Mary, we fulfill this biblical prophecy.

**John 2:1-11** — At the Wedding at Cana, Mary intercedes with Jesus on behalf of the hosts. Jesus responds — even though He says "my hour has not yet come." Mary knew that her Son would hear her request. And her last words recorded in Scripture are an instruction for us: *"Do whatever he tells you"* (Jn 2:5).

**John 19:26-27** — From the Cross, Jesus entrusts Mary to John: *"Woman, behold, your son"* — and to John: *"Behold, your mother."* Tradition sees here the adoption of the entire Church as children of Mary. The word "woman" echoes Genesis 3:15, the promise of the *woman* whose offspring would crush the head of the serpent. At the supreme moment of redemption, Jesus establishes Mary as the spiritual mother of all disciples.

The Catechism reflects: *"This motherhood of Mary in the order of grace continues uninterruptedly [...] until the eternal fulfillment of all the elect"* (CCC §969).

## The New Eve — The Perspective of the Church Fathers

The Church Fathers, from as early as the second century, saw in Mary the **New Eve**:

**Saint Irenaeus of Lyon** (c. 180 AD) wrote one of the most beautiful comparisons:

> "Just as Eve, having Adam as her husband, yet being a virgin, was disobedient and became the cause of death for herself and for the whole human race, so Mary, having her betrothed, and being a virgin, was obedient and became the cause of salvation for herself and for the whole human race."
> — *Adversus Haereses*, III, 22, 4

**Saint Ephrem the Syrian** (4th c.), the great poet of the Eastern Church, sang:

> "Mary and Eve, two people without fault, were made equal. Afterwards, one became the cause of our death, the other the cause of our life."

**Saint Justin Martyr** (c. 155 AD), even before Irenaeus, already affirmed: *"Christ was born of the Virgin so that the disobedience caused by the serpent might be destroyed by the same path through which it had begun."*

This theology does not exalt Mary above Christ — on the contrary, it shows how God acts through symmetry: evil entered the world through a woman and a man; redemption likewise.

## Mary, Mother of the Church

The Second Vatican Council dedicated the entire Chapter VIII of *Lumen Gentium* to the role of Mary. The text is balanced and profound:

> "The Blessed Virgin Mary [...] is recognized and honored as being truly the Mother of God and of the Redeemer [...]. She is also truly 'Mother of the members of Christ' [...] because she cooperated by her charity that the faithful might be born in the Church, who are members of that Head."
> — *Lumen Gentium*, §53

The same document cautions: the veneration of Mary *"neither takes away anything from nor adds anything to the dignity and efficacy of Christ the one Mediator"* (LG §62). Mary is not a mediator *in place of* Christ; she participates in the one mediation of Christ, as we all do when we pray for one another.

The Catechism synthesizes: *"Mary's function as mother of men in no way obscures or diminishes this unique mediation of Christ, but rather shows its power"* (CCC §970).

## The Intercession of the Saints

There is a clear biblical logic for asking for the intercession of other Christians:

**James 5:16** says: *"The fervent prayer of a righteous person is very powerful."*

If you ask a devout friend to pray for you — you are asking for intercession. Does that make sense? For most people, yes.

The question is: why would this stop at death? If the saints are *more* alive in God than we are here (Rev 6:9-10 shows the martyrs interceding before the throne), why not ask for their intercession?

Mary is the first among the saints — not by her own merit, but by pure grace: she is the Mother of Jesus. Her role as intercessor does not compete with the unique priesthood of Christ (1 Tim 2:5) — she intercedes *in Christ*, not as a substitute for Him.

The Catechism explains clearly: *"Because of her Son, Mary is the Mother of all of us"* and *"this motherhood of Mary in the order of grace continues uninterruptedly"* (CCC §963, §969).

## Mary in the Rosary: What Does She Do?

In the Rosary, Mary has a specific function: **she points to Jesus**.

Think about how it works: we pray the Hail Marys, but **we meditate on the mysteries of the life of Christ**. Mary never takes her eyes off Jesus — nor should she turn ours away.

The Rosary is, in truth, a **Christocentric prayer**: we begin with the Apostles' Creed (faith in Christ), we meditate on His life, death, and resurrection, and we do so in the company of His mother.

In the words of Saint John Paul II:

> "The Rosary is at heart a contemplative prayer. Without this contemplative dimension, it would lose its meaning."
> — *Rosarium Virginis Mariae*, §12

And the contemplation is always about Christ — Mary is the *teacher* who shows us how to gaze upon Him. As the Catechism says: *"Prayer to Mary is a privileged path for the contemplation of the face of Christ"* (cf. CCC §2675).

## Exercise: Praying with Mary, Looking at Jesus

Choose one of the mysteries of the Rosary — any one that touches your heart. Before praying the decade, do the following:

1. Read the passage of the Gospel corresponding to the mystery (the references are in the previous reflection)
2. Imagine Mary present in that scene — what does she see? What does she feel?
3. Say softly: *"Mary, show me what you see."*
4. Pray the decade slowly, keeping Mary's gaze as your guide
5. At the end, in silence, give thanks for the companionship

## If the Doubt Persists

If you still have reservations about Marian devotion, do not force yourself. A Rosary prayed with honest doubt but good will has more value than a Rosary prayed out of routine without questioning.

What matters is the intention to reach Christ. If Mary helps with that, good. If for now you prefer to pray *only* to Jesus — pray. The Father of Mercy does not measure prayer by its form, but by the heart.

> "Do not be afraid of being too much for Mary. You will never be enough for Jesus."
> — Saint Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort
