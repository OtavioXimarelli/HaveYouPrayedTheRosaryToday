## The Central Mystery

The mystery of the **Most Holy Trinity** is the central mystery of the faith and the Christian life. It is the mystery of God in Himself. This is, therefore, the source of all other mysteries of faith, the light that illuminates them.

The Church teaches that God is one, but in three distinct persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. They are not "three gods", but one God in three persons who share the same divine substance.

> "The Catholic faith is this: that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity." (Athanasian Creed)

## The Three Divine Persons

1.  **The Father**: Is the origin and principle of all divinity. Was not made, nor created, nor begotten by anyone.
2.  **The Son**: Is begotten by the Father from all eternity. Is the Word of God who became flesh for our salvation.
3.  **The Holy Spirit**: Proceeds from the Father and the Son as the eternal Love that unites them. Is the one who gives life and sanctifies the Church.

## Unity in Distinction

The divine persons do not divide the single divinity among themselves, but each of them is God in His entirety. The Father is all that the Son is, the Son all that the Father is, the Holy Spirit all that the Father and the Son are, that is, one God as to nature.

The real distinction between the persons resides solely in the relationships that refer them to each other:
- It is the Father who begets;
- It is the Son who is begotten;
- It is the Holy Spirit who proceeds.

## Revelation in History

Although the human mind cannot fully understand the Trinity by reason alone, God revealed it in the history of salvation. 

In the Old Testament, God prepared His people for this mystery. In the New Testament, the revelation becomes full: at the Baptism of Jesus, at the Transfiguration, and, supremely, in Jesus' mandate to the apostles: *"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit"* (Mt 28:19).

## The Trinity and the Life of Prayer

Our entire Christian life is marked by the sign of the Trinity. We begin our prayers "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". 

In the Rosary, the prayer of the **Glory Be** is the moment of trinitarian worship par excellence. At the end of each decade, we praise the three divine persons, recognizing that everything we meditate on about the life of Christ and Mary has its origin and end in the glory of the Trinity.

## To Reflect

- God is not solitude, but a communion of love. How does this change my view of who God is?
- We were created in the image and likeness of a God who is community. What does this teach about my relationships with others?
- How can I make my prayer of the "Glory Be" more conscious and profound?

## Prayer to the Most Holy Trinity

*Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord, God of the universe.*  
*Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.*  
*As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be. Amen.*
