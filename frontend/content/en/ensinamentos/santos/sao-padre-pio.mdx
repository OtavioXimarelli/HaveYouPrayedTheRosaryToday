## The Man of the Wounds

Francesco Forgione was born on May 25, 1887, in Pietrelcina, southern Italy, in a family of humble peasants. From a child, he experienced visions and spiritual battles that he would later describe as confrontations with the devil. He entered the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin at age 15, taking the name Brother Pio.

On September 20, 1918, in the convent of San Giovanni Rotondo, Padre Pio received the **stigmata** — the five wounds of Christ's Passion imprinted on his body. He would be the first stigmatized priest in history. He would carry these wounds for **fifty years**, until two days before he died.

## The Rosary: His Weapon and His Breath

Padre Pio did not separate the stigmata from the Rosary. For him, the wounds were the price paid for intercession, and the Rosary was the most powerful form of intercession available to the ordinary Christian.

His devotion to the Rosary was extravagant by modern standards:

- He prayed from **15 to 35 Rosaries a day**
- He slept only 2-3 hours a night, spending the rest in prayer
- He received penitents in the confessional for up to 16-19 hours daily

When asked how so many Rosaries were possible, he replied with typical southern Italian humor: *"I pray one Rosary with my mouth and another with my heart — at the same time."*

His best-known phrase about the Rosary:

> "Love Our Lady and make everyone love her. Always pray the Rosary."

## The Gift of Reading Hearts

Padre Pio became famous for the **gift of discernment** — the ability to know the sins of penitents even before they were confessed, and to perceive inner dispositions that the penitents themselves did not articulate clearly.

Many traveled hundreds of miles to confess with him. Doctors, theologians, peasants, politicians — all in the same line. When someone approached without real contrition, Padre Pio often sent them away, asking them to return more prepared.

John Paul II, then a young priest, confessed with Padre Pio in 1947, and years later stated that Padre Pio had prophesied that he would reach the highest office in the Church.

## Suffering as a Vocation

The theology implicit in Padre Pio's life is that of **redemptive suffering** — the idea that the Christian can offer their sufferings united with the Passion of Christ for the salvation of souls.

Padre Pio wrote in his spiritual letters:

> "The more Jesus Christ loves a soul, the more He makes it participate in His sufferings."

This is not spiritual masochism, but a profound reading of Colossians 1:24 — "Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church."

## Death and Canonization

Padre Pio died on September 23, 1968, in San Giovanni Rotondo, at age 81. On the morning of his death, the stigmata had completely disappeared — the skin was clean, without a scar. He was beatified in 1999 and canonized by Pope John Paul II in 2002.

His work, the **Home for the Relief of Suffering** — a hospital founded by him in 1956 — remains active and is one of the largest hospitals in Italy.

## To Reflect

- Padre Pio prayed dozens of Rosaries daily without considering them mechanical routine. What differentiated his prayer? How can we imitate his inner disposition, even praying just one Rosary?
- Suffering in Padre Pio's spirituality was not avoided, but **offered**. Are there sufferings in your life that you can consciously offer to God today?
- Padre Pio saw confession as a source of spiritual life, not as a punitive obligation. When was your last confession?

## Prayer to Padre Pio

*Holy Padre Pio, who bore the wounds of Christ with love and offered to the Lord every pain,*  
*teach us to pray the Rosary with the same ardor with which you prayed it.*  
*May we not be overcome by the boredom of repetitive prayer,*  
*but may we find in each Hail Mary the face of Mary and the heart of Jesus.*  
*Amen.*

**Feast day:** September 23
