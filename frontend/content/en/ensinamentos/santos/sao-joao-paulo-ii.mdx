## The Boy from Wadowice

Karol Józef Wojtyła was born on May 18, 1920, in Wadowice, a small town in southern Poland about 50 kilometers from Kraków. He was the youngest of three children of Karol Wojtyła, a Polish army officer, and Emilia Kaczorowska, a woman of fragile health and unshakeable faith.

Karol's childhood was marked by losses that irrevocably shaped his soul. His mother died when he was only **nine years old**, in 1929, overcome by heart and kidney problems. Three years later, in 1932, his older brother Edmund — a young doctor who contracted scarlet fever from a patient — died at the age of 26. When Karol was **twenty years old**, in 1941, his father died of a heart attack. The young man came home and found the body already cold.

> "By the age of twenty I had already lost all the people I loved."

None of these losses led him to despair. Instead, each one pushed him more deeply into the arms of **Mary**. When his mother died, his father took him to the Marian shrine of Kalwaria Zebrzydowska and told him: *"Karol, your earthly mother is gone. Now your mother is Her."* From that day forward, the boy was never separated from Our Lady.

## Youth under Nazism and Communism

The Poland of Karol Wojtyła was trampled by two totalitarian regimes in succession. In September 1939, Nazi Germany invaded the country. The University of Kraków was shut down. Professors were deported to concentration camps. Most of Karol's Jewish friends — among them Jerzy Kluger, his childhood companion — were exterminated in the Holocaust.

To escape deportation for forced labor in Germany, Karol worked as a laborer in a **quarry** and later in a **chemical factory**. There, between exhausting shifts and the constant danger of the occupation, **he prayed the Rosary hidden** beneath his work overalls. Prayer was his refuge, his silent resistance against dehumanization.

In 1942, feeling called to the priesthood, he clandestinely entered the **underground seminary** organized by the Archbishop of Kraków, Archbishop Adam Stefan Sapieha. Studying theology was forbidden by the Nazis under penalty of death. Karol and his classmates risked their lives every time they gathered to study.

After the war came the Soviet occupation. Communism tried to crush Poland's Catholic faith through persecution, censorship, and intimidation. Karol, already a priest (ordained in 1946) and later a bishop (1958) and cardinal (1967), became a **bulwark of spiritual resistance** — not with political weapons, but with prayer, the sacraments, and a quiet courage that disarmed the oppressors.

Throughout this entire journey, the Rosary was always in his hands.

## The Rosary in His Youth: The Living Rosary

A significant detail connects Karol Wojtyła directly to the history of this platform: as a young man, before the war, the future Pope participated in a **Living Rosary group** in Wadowice — a practice in which each member of a group of twenty people prays one decade of the Rosary daily, so that together they complete the entire Rosary.

This experience of **communal prayer** profoundly shaped his understanding of the Rosary. For Karol, the Rosary was never a purely individual prayer; it was always an **ecclesial** prayer, prayed with and for the community of the faithful.

Decades later, as Pope, he would recall:

> "The Rosary is my favorite prayer. A marvelous prayer! Marvelous in its simplicity and its depth. In this prayer we repeat many times the words that the Virgin Mary heard from the Archangel and from her cousin Elizabeth."

## *Totus Tuus*: The Consecration of a Lifetime

When Karol Wojtyła was elected Pope on **October 16, 1978** — the first non-Italian pope in 455 years, the first Slavic pope in history — the world was surprised by his first words as Pontiff: *"Be not afraid!"* And by his episcopal and papal motto: ***Totus Tuus*** — "Totally Yours, O Mary."

This motto was no devotional flourish. It came directly from **Saint Louis Marie de Montfort**, whose *True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary* Karol had first read as a young worker in the Solvay chemical factory during the Nazi occupation. John Paul II himself testified:

> "The reading of Saint Louis de Montfort's *Treatise* was a turning point in my spiritual life. I understood that true devotion to Mary does not take us away from Christ but leads us unfailingly to Him."

The Montfortian consecration shaped all of Wojtyła's spirituality: total entrustment to Jesus through the hands of Mary, confidence that Our Lady is the surest path to the Son, certainty that belonging to Mary is the most complete way of belonging to Christ.

This conviction was not abstract. It manifested in daily gestures: the Pope prayed **the complete Rosary every day** — the three traditional sets, and later all four. Secretaries, collaborators, and guards testified that, **before dawn**, they would already find him prostrate on his knees in the private chapel, Rosary in hand. Every important decision of the pontificate — appointments, encyclicals, travels — was preceded by hours of prayer before the Blessed Sacrament and the recitation of the Rosary.

## May 13, 1981: The Bullet and the Mother

On May 13, 1981 — the **liturgical feast of Our Lady of Fatima** — Pope John Paul II was shot in Saint Peter's Square by the Turk Mehmet Ali Ağca. The bullet struck his abdomen, passing **within millimeters of the aorta** and other vital organs. The surgeons who operated on him declared that his survival was inexplicable from a surgical standpoint.

John Paul II had no doubt whatsoever about what had happened. He attributed his survival entirely to Our Lady of Fatima:

> "One hand fired the bullet; another hand guided its path."

A year later, in thanksgiving, the Pope traveled to **Fatima** and personally placed the bullet that had struck him in the crown of the statue of Our Lady of Fatima, where it remains to this day. There, prostrate before the image, he consecrated the entire world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary — fulfilling, according to many theologians, the request Our Lady had made to the three shepherd children in 1917.

The coincidence of dates — the assassination attempt on May 13, the feast of Fatima — was no coincidence for John Paul II. It was **Providence**. The Rosary, the central prayer of the message of Fatima, became even more intimate for him: not only his favorite prayer, but a prayer that had literally **saved his life**.

## The Apostolic Letter *Rosarium Virginis Mariae* (2002)

On **October 16, 2002** — the twenty-fourth anniversary of his election — John Paul II published the apostolic letter ***Rosarium Virginis Mariae***, the most important document on the Rosary written in recent centuries. With this letter, he accomplished something no one had done in **700 years**: he modified the structure of the Rosary.

To the three traditional sets — **Joyful**, **Sorrowful**, and **Glorious** — he added a fourth set: the **Luminous Mysteries** (*Mysteria Lucis*), contemplating the public ministry of Jesus Christ:

1. **The Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan** — when the Father reveals the beloved Son
2. **The Wedding Feast at Cana** — when Mary says "Do whatever he tells you"
3. **The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God** — when Christ calls to conversion
4. **The Transfiguration** — when divine glory shines forth on Mount Tabor
5. **The Institution of the Eucharist** — when Christ gives himself as food

The motivation was both theological and pastoral: the traditional mysteries jumped from the infancy of Jesus directly to the Passion, without contemplating the years of public life. John Paul II wanted the Rosary to be a **true compendium of the Gospel** — no essential aspect of the life of Christ should remain outside contemplation.

In *Rosarium*, he wrote words that became normative for the Catholic understanding of the Rosary:

> "The Rosary, though clearly Marian in character, is at heart a Christocentric prayer. In the sobriety of its elements, it has all the depth of the Gospel message in its entirety, of which it can be said to be a compendium."

## The Rosary as Contemplation: The Pedagogy of the *Rosarium*

The most profound theological contribution of John Paul II was not simply adding the Luminous Mysteries — it was **redefining the Rosary as a contemplative prayer**, definitively distinguishing it from mere devotional recitation.

In *Rosarium Virginis Mariae*, he proposed a concrete pedagogy for praying the Rosary with depth:

- **The announcement of the mystery** — accompanied, if possible, by the reading of the corresponding biblical text
- **Silence** — a pause before each decade, so that the Gospel scene may take shape in the imagination
- **Contemplation** — praying the Hail Marys while the soul "dwells" in the mystery, seeing what the characters saw, hearing what they said
- **The Our Father** — which opens each decade, reminding us that all contemplation is directed to the Father
- **The Glory Be** — which closes each decade in Trinitarian praise
- **The concluding prayer** — a brief pause to gather the spiritual fruit of the mystery contemplated

This pedagogy was not entirely new — it synthesized the Carthusian, Dominican, and Carmelite traditions — but its formulation in an apostolic letter made it accessible to the universal Church. John Paul II was not legislating about the Rosary; he was **educating** the Church to pray it.

> "With the Rosary, the Christian people sit at the school of Mary and are led to contemplate the beauty of the face of Christ and to experience the depth of his love."

John Paul II declared October 2002 to October 2003 the **Year of the Rosary**, inviting the entire Church to rediscover this prayer.

## The Final Years: The Rosary in Suffering

The final years of John Paul II were a silent and poignant testimony to the power of prayer in suffering. **Parkinson's disease**, diagnosed in the 1990s, progressively robbed him of control over his body. The Pope who had crossed the globe on apostolic journeys, who skied, swam, and hiked vigorously, was reduced to a wheelchair, with a nearly inaudible voice and a face disfigured by illness.

But the Rosary never left his hands. Collaborators testified that, even when he could no longer articulate words, **his lips continued to move** in silent prayer. When he could no longer hold the rosary beads firmly, the nurses would wrap them around his fingers.

In his last public appearance at the Vatican window, a few days before his death, John Paul II tried to speak and could not. He raised his hand to his forehead in a gesture of frustration — and then **grasped the Rosary and held it up to the crowd**. It was his final message: *Pray.*

## Death and Legacy

Saint John Paul II died on **April 2, 2005**, on the vigil of the **Feast of Divine Mercy** — a feast he himself had instituted in the Jubilee Year 2000. He was 84 years old. His last known words were:

> "Let me go to the house of the Father."

Saint Peter's Square filled with the faithful praying the Rosary aloud in every language of the world. The vigil lasted through the night. At the funeral, the crowds raised signs in dozens of languages with a single phrase: ***Santo subito!*** — "A saint now!"

He was beatified on **May 1, 2011** and **canonized on April 27, 2014** by Pope Francis, together with Saint John XXIII.

The Marian legacy of John Paul II is immense: the Montfortian consecration popularized for the entire Church, *Rosarium Virginis Mariae* as a normative document, the Luminous Mysteries that completed the evangelical meditation of the Rosary, and above all the **witness of an entire life** prayed with the rosary in hand.

For Saint John Paul II, the Rosary was not a prayer for obtaining things. It was simply **being with Mary, gazing upon Christ** — the very thing Mary had been doing since the Annunciation. And that was enough.

## For Reflection

- John Paul II lost his mother at age 9, his brother at 12, his father at 20, and saw his Jewish friends exterminated. What sustained his faith was Mary. What sustains *your* faith in times of loss and trial?
- The Pope added the Luminous Mysteries to the Rosary after 700 years of stable practice. This scandalized some and delighted others. How do you relate to legitimate changes in the devotion of the Church?
- John Paul II proposed that the Rosary be prayed with **silence, imagery, and listening**. Try today to pray at least one decade according to these guidelines. How does the experience change when you pause before contemplating?
- The Pope, in his final days, could no longer speak — but he held up the Rosary at the window. What message does this gesture hold for your own life of prayer?

## Prayer to Saint John Paul II

*Saint John Paul II,*
*shepherd who loved the Rosary*
*as a child's inheritance and as an old man's strength,*
*as a worker's weapon and as a Pontiff's scepter,*

*intercede that the Church may never abandon*
*this simple and profound prayer.*
*May the young people of this generation find in Mary*
*what you found: not a substitute for Christ,*
*but the shortest road to Him.*

*May we pray as you prayed:*
*on our knees, in silence, with open hearts,*
*contemplating the face of Christ in the mysteries of the Rosary,*
*from the Joyful to the Luminous, from the Sorrowful to the Glorious.*

*And when we can no longer speak,*
*may the Rosary in our hands speak for us.*

*Through Christ our Lord.*
*Amen.*

**Liturgical feast day:** October 22
