## Karol — The Boy from Wadowice

Karol Józef Wojtyła was born on May 18, 1920, in Wadowice, Poland. He lost his mother at 9, his brother at 12, and his father at 20. By the time he was 24, most of his Jewish friends had been exterminated in Nazi concentration camps.

These early blows shaped a man who would learn to face suffering not with bitterness, but with faith — a faith that had the face of Mary. His papal motto, *Totus Tuus* ("Totally Yours, O Mary"), came directly from Saint Louis de Montfort.

Young Karol attended a living Rosary group before the war. Decades later, Pope John Paul II would state:

> "The Rosary is my favorite prayer. It is a wonderful prayer! Wonderful in its simplicity and its depth."

## The Pope who Prayed on His Knees

John Paul II was elected Pope on October 16, 1978 — the first non-Italian pope in 455 years. His pontificate would last almost 27 years.

A constant witnessed by everyone who lived with him: **he prayed on his knees for hours**. Secretaries and guards regularly found him prostrate in prayer before dawn. The Rosary was an invariable part of this daily prayer.

He survived an assassination attempt on May 13, 1981 — **the feast of Our Lady of Fatima** — by a bullet that passed millimeters from his aorta. He attributed his survival to Our Lady and placed the bullet that hit him in the crown of the statue of Our Lady of Fatima, where it remains today.

> "One hand fired the bullet; another hand deflected it."

## The Apostolic Letter *Rosarium Virginis Mariae* (2002)

In October 2002, John Paul II published the apostolic letter that would forever change the structure of the Rosary. He added to the three traditional groups (Joyful, Sorrowful, Glorious) a fourth group: the **Luminous Mysteries** — meditating on the public ministry of Christ:

1. The Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan
2. The Wedding at Cana
3. The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God
4. The Transfiguration
5. The Institution of the Eucharist

John Paul II declared October 2002 to October 2003 the **Year of the Rosary**. In the letter, he wrote:

> "With the Rosary, the Christian people sits at the school of Mary and is led to contemplate the beauty of the face of Christ and to experience the depth of his love."

## The Rosary as Contemplation

John Paul II's deepest theological contribution to the Rosary was not just adding the Luminous Mysteries — it was redefining the Rosary as **contemplative prayer**, not as a simple devotional count.

In *Rosarium*, he wrote that praying the Rosary well requires:

- **Silence** — a pause before each mystery
- **Image** — visualizing the scene from the Gospel
- **Listening** — letting the Word of God sound within
- **Silence again** — after the Angelic Salutation, contemplative rest

This pedagogy of contemplation was not an innovation: it was a faithful synthesis of the Carthusian and Dominican tradition, re-presented for the 21st-century man.

## The End and the Promise

John Paul II died on April 2, 2005, on the eve of the Feast of Divine Mercy — a date he himself had instituted. Beatified in 2011, canonized in 2014.

His last known public words were: *"Let me go to the house of the Father."*

Saint John Paul II did not pray the Rosary to get things. He prayed because, for him, the Rosary was simply **being with Mary, looking at Christ** — the same thing Mary had done since the Annunciation.

## To Reflect

- John Paul II went through devastating losses in his youth and maintained his faith. What sustains your faith in losses?
- The Pope reformulated the Rosary after 700 years of stable practice. This scandalized some, gladdened others. How do you relate to legitimate changes in the Church's devotion?
- Try today to pray the Rosary according to the guidelines of *Rosarium*: with pause, image, and listening. How does the experience change?

## Prayer to Saint John Paul II

*Holy John Paul II, shepherd who loved the Rosary as a child's heritage and as an elder's strength,*  
*intercede that the Church may not abandon this simple and profound prayer.*  
*May the young people of this generation find in Mary what you found:*  
*not a substitute for Christ, but the shortest road to Him.*  
*Amen.*

**Feast day:** October 22
