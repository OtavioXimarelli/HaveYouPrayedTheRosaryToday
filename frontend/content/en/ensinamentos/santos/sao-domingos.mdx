## Who was Saint Dominic?

Saint Dominic de Guzmán was born around 1170, in Caleruega, in the Kingdom of Castile. From a young age, he showed an ardent devotion to prayer and an acute sensitivity to the poverty of others. Tradition says that while still a young student in Palencia, he sold his books — precious and rare at the time — to feed the hungry during a great famine.

Ordained a priest, he became a canon of the Cathedral of Osma, where he lived in community according to the Rule of Saint Augustine. It was during a journey with his bishop to the south of France that Dominic first encountered the spiritual devastation caused by the **Cathar heresy** — a movement that denied the goodness of material creation and refused the sacraments of the Church.

## The Mission in Southern France

From 1206, Dominic spent years preaching in Languedoc, a region taken over by Catharism. Unlike the papal legates who arrived with pomp and ceremony, Dominic adopted apostolic poverty: he traveled through the villages on foot, barefoot, preaching with arguments and by example.

> "Heresy is not fought with armies, but with humility, prayer, and the preaching of the truth."

In this context of spiritual struggle, Dominican tradition states that Our Lady appeared to Dominic and handed him the Rosary. Our Lady is said to have said:

> "This will be the sign of predestination. Preach the Rosary and you will see many sinners converted."

Although historians debate the exact form of this event, the unanimous testimony of the first Dominican disciples is that Dominic popularized and systematized the prayer of the Rosary as an instrument of evangelization.

## The Foundation of the Order of Preachers

In 1216, Pope Honorius III officially approved the **Order of Preachers** — the Dominicans. Founded to combine rigorous study, mendicant poverty, and itinerant preaching, the Order was born to respond to a crisis in the Church with the weapon of the word.

Dominic died in Bologna, Italy, on August 6, 1221, exhausted by apostolic work. He was canonized just thirteen years later, in 1234, by Pope Gregory IX — an extraordinary speed for the medieval canonization process.

## The Rosary as an Inheritance

Saint Dominic did not invent the Rosary from scratch. The practice of reciting 150 Hail Marys, in parallelism with the 150 Psalms, already existed in embryonic form among medieval monks. What Dominic did — and what Our Lady revealed — was to unite these Hail Marys with the contemplative meditation on the **mysteries** of Christ's life, creating a form of prayer accessible to illiterate people.

Each bead of the Rosary is, therefore, an echo of the Dominican apostolate: prayer that instructs, consoles, and converts.

## To Reflect

- Dominic chose poverty and dialogue when he could have used power and coercion. What does this say about the legitimate means of evangelization?
- Our Lady entrusted the Rosary to a preacher. How is this connection between the Rosary and preaching reflected in your own life of faith?
- In what areas of your life do you need the "weapon of the Rosary" that Dominic received?

## Prayer to Saint Dominic

*Glorious Saint Dominic, who received from Our Lady the sacred Rosary and preached it with such fruit,*  
*intercede for us so that we may be faithful to this devotion.*  
*May we, like you, combat error with humility and prayer.*  
*Amen.*
